# Linux-Admin-GUI

I've developed a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Bash scripts, designed to simplify and enhance Red Hat administrative tasks, making them more accessible for both new and seasoned Linux administrators. This project streamlines complex operations into an intuitive interface, bridging the gap between the simplicity of Windows' GUI and the power of Linux systems.
